Virtual Labs is an initiative by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, to provide remote access to labs in various disciplines of Science and Engineering 1. The labs are designed to cater to students at the undergraduate level, postgraduate level, and research scholars. The labs are available in various domains such as Electronics & Communications, Computer Science & Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Biotechnology and Biomedical Engineering, Physical Sciences, and Chemical Sciences 1.

The Virtual Labs at IIT Bombay offer a range of labs such as Chemical Engineering Simulation Labs, Simulation of Control of Magnetic Levitation System, Urban Transportation Systems Planning Lab, Virtual Proteomics Laboratory, Single Board Heater system Electronic Devices and Circuits, Traffic Engineering Laboratory 1. The labs provide students with the result of an experiment by one of the following methods: modeling the physical phenomenon by a set of equations and carrying out simulations to yield the result of the particular experiment; providing measured data for virtual lab experiments corresponding to the data previously obtained by measurements on an actual system; remotely triggering an experiment in an actual lab and providing the student with the result of the experiment through the computer interface 1.

The Virtual Labs aim to enthuse students to conduct experiments by arousing their curiosity. They provide a complete Learning Management System around the Virtual Labs where students can avail themselves of various tools for learning, including additional web-resources, video-lectures, animated demonstrations, and self-evaluation 1.
